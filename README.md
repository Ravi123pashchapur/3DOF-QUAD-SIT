# 3DOF-QUAD-SIT
This repo discus about the dynamics and control functionalities of 3DOF hover QUAD

# Step: 1
--> Install Matlab & Simulink 2020b or higher version. 
--> Clone the repo in your local directory and rename it to 3DOF hover

# Step: 2
--> Once you clone it copy the path and open Matlab
--> You can see 3DOFQUAD.prj project file in current folder section, double click and open the project.
--> Project will automatically load the simulation constant parameters.

# Step: 3
--> Open the Linear_State_Space_Model.slx simulink model and run it with different voltage input to check model behaivior.
